# ruby-define-method package

Adds ruby-define-method:new_instance_method command converts a line of text into a method name with shift+enter like in Textmate. 
Please note, I'm still learning my way around Atom's view system and the code is probably horrible, improvements are welcomed!

To install:
```
git clone git@github.com:alexchee/atom-ruby-define-method.git ~/.atom/packages/ruby-define-method

TODO:
 * Scope command to only ruby files, [when atom has built-in support](http://discuss.atom.io/t/how-do-i-scope-a-keymap-to-a-grammar/3842) or get this working https://github.com/tcarlsen/atom-keymap-plus
 * specs 
 * maybe add other Ruby Textmate commands
